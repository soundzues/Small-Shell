# Small-Shell
Wrote my own shell in C similar to bash.
The Shell supports redirection of standard input and output, foreground and background processes, supports built in commands, comments and responds to signals. 

To compile the program:
gcc -o smallsh smallsh.c

To run the executable simple run:
./smallsh
